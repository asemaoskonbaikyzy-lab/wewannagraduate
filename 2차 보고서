ScheduleSync – Second Project Report (2차 보고서)

1. Project Name and Team Information
-------------------------------------
Project Name: ScheduleSync
Team Name: 졸업하고싶죠
Team Number: 23
Members:
- Makhmud Lailim (Team Leader): Project management, scheduling, report writing, meetings with advisor, requirements definition, verification, communication
- Oskonbai kyzy Asema: Fullstack developer, Firebase integration, UI/UX prototyping, technical implementation, testing/debugging

2. Project Summary and Background
----------------------------------
Objectives & Scope:
- Make planning social activities among students faster and easier
- Allow users to share availability and suggest group events from inside the calendar itself
- Support simple yes/no workflows for group coordination (accept/decline)
- Target users: Ewha Womans University Computer Science students and friends
- Focus on real-time free-time matching and group proposal features

Necessity & Background:
- Problem: University students struggle to plan meetings due to busy schedules and poor coordination tools.
- Messages get lost in group chats, causing confusion and canceled plans.
- Existing tools (Google Calendar, KakaoTalk) are not designed for group social planning.
- No tool gives a clear mutual view of free time or seamless workflow for proposing/accepting group activities in a social context.

3. Target Users & Research Basis
---------------------------------
Target Users:
- Ewha Womans University CS students
- Students in project-based courses and clubs
- Groups who frequently plan meals, meetings, outings

User Research:
- Peers reported issues with clashing schedules, messy group chats, and needing multiple apps to agree on one plan
- Key pain points: hard to see mutual availability and frustration from inefficient, repetitive messaging

4. Problems, Needs, and Proposed Solution
------------------------------------------
Key Problems:
- Hard to find compatible times for group activities
- Excessive, repetitive back-and-forth messaging
- No easy way to see friends' real-time availability
- No group plan proposal/acceptance feature in existing tools
- Social plans often collapse due to "coordination friction"

User Needs:
- Simple, shared calendar for easy visibility
- Instant updates when friends accept/decline events
- Less reliance on messaging apps for scheduling
- Real-time synced updates across friends’ devices
- Lightweight, student-friendly, privacy-respecting tool

Proposed Solution:
- ScheduleSync is a browser-based web app with:
    - User registration and friend calendar sharing
    - Instant mutual free/busy view
    - One-click group event proposals/acceptances in-app
    - All coordination inside the calendar, not in scattered chats
    - Real-time sync via Firebase, easy sharing, no install required
    - Designed for casual, fast social planning

7. System Design & Implementation
----------------------------------
7.1 SW Architecture
- Frontend: ReactJS web interface (login, scheduling, event/friend management)
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore for data, Auth for login, Hosting for deployment), Vercel for live hosting, GitHub for source control

7.2 Data Flow
- Users log in, manage time blocks, events, and friends in web app
- All info sent to Firebase, instantly synced for friends
- Event suggestions and friend requests update in real-time

7.3 Main Screens & Functions
- Home: Overview of main features
- Scheduler: Add/manage availability
- Event Page: View/suggest/edit group events
- Friend List: Send/manage friend requests
- Customized Events: Events with specific details sync for all invited friends
- Time Blocks: Define and sync weekly availability

7.4 Expected Effects
- Real-time updates improve group coordination
- Quick event response, less scheduling conflict/messaging clutter
- Expands potential for group/community planning

7.5 Unique Aspects & Improvements
- Integrates scheduling, event proposals, and friend management
- Real-time updates and friend-based access core to system
- No app install; fast and easy for student social planning

8. Development Progress & Milestones
-------------------------------------
Phase 1:
- Set up GitHub repo, React project, initialized Firebase
Phase 2:
- Implemented event creation, calendar display, Firebase auth
Phase 3:
- Friend list logic and group event features in progress, real-time sync/UX improvements underway

Current Status:
- Core structure, UI/backend modules working
- Firebase configured, initial connectivity tested
- All planned features organized/documented
- Low-fidelity UI wireframe complete
- No functional UI yet—feature dev is next
- Planned: mobile UI polish, friend search, notifications

9. Verification & Testing
--------------------------
- Firebase real-time updates tested between multiple users
- Event creation/editing/group flows verified
- Deployed on Vercel, cross-browser tested
- Planned: more user testing, mobile layout improvements
